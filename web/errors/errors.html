        <a href="post_edgecase.html">edge case in the code</a> when a POST or PUT request wants to create a file in a folder which doesn't exist yet,
        with the folder name equal to the name of a file that does already exist.
        <br><br> <b>For example:</b> the file /error_data/edgecase exists. A POST request is called to the file
        /error_data/edgecase/does_not_exist_yet.txt . The server will try to create the file, but it can't create the
        folder 'edgecase' because there already exists a file with the same name. <br><br>
        (this error can be caught, but we do not do this on purpose to show off what happens when an exception is thrown in the server code).
